Create a Repo using CLI

Open Git Bash.

Navigate to the root directory of your project.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository. By default, the initial branch is called main.

If you’re using Git 2.28.0 or a later version, you can set the name of the default branch using -b.

git init -b main
If you’re using Git 2.27.1 or an earlier version, you can set the name of the default branch using git symbolic-ref.

git init && git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

$ git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

$ git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
